# Plotly-Challenge
[Index.html](index.html) utilizes the javascript file [app.js](static/js/app.js) to make visualizations of the [data](data/samples.json) found in the data folder. The javascript file builds three charts and a table, as well as populates a dropdown menu with all of the IDs of different people that the data was taken from, each chart (and the table) is then redone to match the data for the individual selected in the dropdown menu.
